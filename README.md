# LMS
First Project (LMS/ Library Management System)
This project is a simple Library Management System (LMS) implemented in C **BY USING ARRAYS**. The LMS provides six main functions to manage a library's book inventory and book issuing process:

AddBook(): Adds a new book to the library.
ViewBookList(): Displays a list of all available books.
RemoveBook(): Removes a book from the library.
IssueBook(): Issues a book to a student.
ViewIssueBook(): Displays a list of all issued books.
ReturnBook(): Handles the return of an issued book.

=========**Usage Instructions**============

Save the code in a new file to avoid conflicts with existing files.
The program uses three text files: books.txt, issue.txt, and temp.txt. Ensure these filenames are not already in use in your working directory.

==========**Important Notes**==============

The project is written in C and uses file handling to manage the library's data.
Make sure the text files (books.txt, issue.txt, and temp.txt) do not pre-exist in your working directory to prevent data conflicts.
